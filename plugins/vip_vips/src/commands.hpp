// vip_vips — console and chat command registration on top of s2sdk (PITFALLS.md C11).
//
// What s2sdk does (con_command_manager.cpp, 3.0.x):
//   * a "!name" / "/name" line in chat is cut after the trigger, tokenised and dispatched to the
//     AddConsoleCommand callback with ConCommandContext::Chat; no ConVar flag is checked on that
//     path, so the callback must decide which sources a name answers for;
//   * a line typed without a trigger ("vips") is not a command at all: it only reaches the
//     "say"/"say_team" command listeners.
//
// This module keeps the split the Metamod plugin had: "sm_vips" and "mm_vips" answer in a console
// only, "vips" answers in both, and the bare chat word "vips" is matched on say/say_team. Every
// registration is removed in OnPluginEnd (PITFALLS A7), and a command name that already existed
// (which s2sdk cannot destroy) loses only our listener.
